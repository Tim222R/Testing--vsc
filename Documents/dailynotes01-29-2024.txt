Git Hub
Git is a version control system that helps you manage and track changes to your files and collaborate with others on software development projects. It's like a time machine for your code that allows you to keep track of every change, revert to earlier versions, and work on unique features simultaneously without messing things up.

Here are some key concepts to understand Git:

· Repository (Repo): A Git repository is like a folder that holds all the files and history for a project. It's where Git stores every version of your files.

· Commit: A commit is like a snapshot of your project at a specific point in time. You make commits to save your changes and give each commit a descriptive message to explain what you did.

· Branch: A branch is a separate line of development within a repository. You can create branches to work on new features or bug fixes without affecting the main project until you're ready.

· Merge: Merging is the process of combining changes from one branch (usually a feature branch) into another (often the main branch) to incorporate new features or bug fixes.

· Clone: Cloning is creating a copy of a Git repository on your local computer. It allows you to work on the project locally and push your changes back to the remote repository when you're ready.

· Pull: Pulling is the process of getting the latest changes from a remote repository (like GitHub or GitLab) to your local repository.

· Push: Pushing is sending your local commits to a remote repository so that others can see and use your changes.

· Pull Request (PR): In many Git hosting platforms like GitHub, a pull request is a way to propose changes to a project. It allows others to review your changes before they are merged into the main branc
