    According to World Economic Forum, Hi Tim "A Boston  Consulting Group study found that companies with more diverse management teams have 19% higher revenues due to innovation." It's not just the management team alone, and it spreads across the entire brand.

    Diversity is a potent tool for the growth of your business, as there is a synergy of experts with different views and ideas. Diversity and inclusivity lead to a supportive work environment that gives an ambiance of accomodating varying perspectives on any issue.
