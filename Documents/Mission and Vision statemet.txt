The future is now - create a diverse workforce now . - build momentum by tackling smaller initiatives -- underepresented candidates are weeded out.*-projejcted jobs focus on expectations- add round robin to meeting-( ask every person in room for contribution to the discussion) see t-the the big picture -there is richness in diversityu as it gives your business a well-balanced setup that's lacking in a homogeous work enviroment

According to World Economic Forum, "A Boston Consulting Group study found that companies with more diverse management teams have 19% higher revenues due to innovation." It's not just the management team alone, and it spreads across the entire brand.

Diversity is a potent tool for the growth of your business, as there is a synergy of experts with different views and ideas. Diversity and inclusivity lead to a supportive work environment that gives an ambiance of accomodating varying perspectives on any issue.

A paradigm shift and the ability to see through diversity as an opportunity to expand the horizon of growth, productivity and resourcefulness of your brand is one that business owners should adopt. It has many advantages and benefits to your brand's objectives both in the short- and long-term.
